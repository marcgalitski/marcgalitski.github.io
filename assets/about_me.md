# Vision

I envision a world where humans work alongside autonomous machines. Menial jobs will be replaced and new jobs are created. Managing algorithms will become a discipline of the future and teaching people in laymans terms how these operate, will be of incredible value. To accomplish this, we must find ways to transform complicated & abstract academic knowledge into graspable concept. This I put forth as my mission: explaining difficult concepts in simple and engaging ways.
